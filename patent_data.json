  "part2_background": "Multiple myeloma is a hematological malignancy characterized by the clonal proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow. Despite significant advances in treatment over the past two decades, including the introduction of proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies, multiple myeloma remains largely incurable. A substantial portion of patients eventually relapse or become refractory to existing therapies, leading to a poor prognosis. A particularly challenging patient population is those who have become refractory to B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeting therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies and antibody-drug conjugates. This creates a significant unmet medical need for novel therapeutic agents with distinct mechanisms of action and improved safety profiles for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).\n\nBispecific antibodies that engage T-cells have emerged as a promising immunotherapeutic strategy for various cancers. These molecules are engineered to simultaneously bind to a tumor-associated antigen on cancer cells and an activating receptor, such as CD3, on the surface of T-cells. This dual binding effectively creates a synapse between the T-cell and the cancer cell, leading to T-cell activation and subsequent lysis of the tumor cell. This mechanism of action, known as T-cell redirection, is independent of the T-cell receptor's native specificity and can overcome tumor escape mechanisms related to downregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules.\n\nOne promising target for multiple myeloma is the Fc Receptor Homolog 5 (FcRH5), also known as IRTA2 or CD307. FcRH5 is a type I transmembrane protein and a member of the immunoglobulin receptor superfamily. Its expression is highly restricted to B-cells and plasma cells, and it is expressed at high levels on the surface of malignant plasma cells in nearly all multiple myeloma patients, while showing minimal expression on normal tissues. This expression profile makes FcRH5 an attractive target for antibody-based therapies.\n\nCevostamab (BFCR4350A), a T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody targeting FcRH5 and CD3, has shown clinical activity in patients with RRMM. However, like many T-cell engagers, its use can be associated with significant toxicities, most notably Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS). CRS is a systemic inflammatory response caused by the release of large quantities of cytokines from activated immune cells. It can range in severity from mild, flu-like symptoms to a life-threatening condition requiring intensive medical care. To mitigate the risk of severe CRS, agents like cevostamab are often administered using a complex step-up dosing regimen, where patients receive one or more lower, priming doses before escalating to the target therapeutic dose. While effective at reducing toxicity, step-up dosing complicates treatment administration, increases the burden on patients and healthcare systems, and may delay the time to achieving a therapeutic dose. Furthermore, first-generation bispecific antibodies can suffer from suboptimal developability characteristics, such as a propensity for aggregation, low solubility, or potential immunogenicity, which can impact manufacturing, stability, and clinical performance.\n\nTherefore, there remains a critical need for improved FcRH5 x CD3 bispecific antibodies that retain or enhance anti-tumor efficacy while exhibiting a superior safety and developability profile. Specifically, there is a need for antibody variants with reduced potential to induce CRS, thereby enabling simpler and more convenient administration schedules, such as a fixed-dose regimen, without the need for step-up dosing. Such improvements would significantly enhance the therapeutic index and clinical utility of this therapeutic modality for patients with advanced multiple myeloma.",
  "part3_summary": "The present invention provides novel engineered bispecific antibody variants that bind to human Fc Receptor Homolog 5 (FcRH5) and human CD3. These variants are designed to have improved therapeutic and biophysical properties compared to existing FcRH5 x CD3 bispecific antibodies, such as the parent molecule cevostamab. The improvements include, but are not limited to, a reduced propensity to induce cytokine release, enhanced stability, lower aggregation potential, and favorable immunogenicity profiles. These enhanced features enable the implementation of simplified and safer dosing regimens, such as fixed-dose administration, which are more convenient for patients and clinicians.\n\nIn one aspect, the invention provides an isolated bispecific antibody, or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, that specifically binds to human FcRH5 and human CD3, wherein the antibody comprises at least one modification in its amino acid sequence compared to a parent antibody. The modification results in one or more improved properties, such as reduced cytokine release in vitro, improved thermal stability, or a lower in silico aggregation score. The antibody may comprise a heavy chain variable (VH) domain and a light chain variable (VL) domain that specifically bind to FcRH5, and a VH and a VL domain that specifically bind to CD3.\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising the novel bispecific antibody variants described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. These compositions are formulated for parenteral administration, such as intravenous or subcutaneous injection, and are stable for storage and clinical use. The formulations are particularly suited for administration as a fixed dose.\n\nIn a further aspect, the invention provides methods for treating a hematological malignancy in a subject in need thereof. The method comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of the bispecific antibody variant or pharmaceutical composition of the invention. In certain embodiments, the hematological malignancy is multiple myeloma, including relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, and particularly multiple myeloma that is refractory to BCMA-targeting therapies.

The methods provided herein result in reduced incidence or severity of cytokine release syndrome compared to treatment with parent antibodies.",

      "text": "Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. \n\nThe term \"antibody\" as used herein is intended to include whole antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. An \"antibody fragment\" comprises a portion of a full-length antibody, generally the antigen-binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules (e.g., scFv); and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.\n\nThe term \"bispecific antibody\" refers to an antibody that has two different antigen-binding specificities. In the context of the present invention, a bispecific antibody specifically binds to human FcRH5 and human CD3. The format of the bispecific antibody can vary and includes, but is not limited to, IgG-like formats with a common light chain, knob-in-hole formats, CrossMAb formats, and various single-chain or fragment-based formats.\n\nThe term \"Fc Receptor Homolog 5\" or \"FcRH5\" refers to the human FcRH5 protein, a type I transmembrane protein also known as IRTA2 or CD307. It is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is primarily expressed on B-lineage cells, including multiple myeloma cells.\n\nThe term \"CD3\" refers to the cluster of differentiation 3 protein complex, which is a T-cell co-receptor. The human CD3 complex is composed of four distinct chains (CD3\u03b3, CD3\u03b4, and two CD3\u03b5 chains) and is associated with the T-cell receptor (TCR).\n\nThe term \"variant\" or \"antibody variant\" refers to an antibody molecule as described herein that comprises one or more amino acid sequence modifications (e.g., substitutions, insertions, or deletions) in the variable and/or constant regions compared to a parent antibody. In the context of the present invention, variants are engineered to possess at least one improved property.\n\nThe term \"improved property\" refers to a desirable characteristic of an antibody variant that is enhanced compared to a parent antibody. Examples of improved properties include, but are not limited to, reduced induction of cytokine release, reduced immunogenicity, enhanced thermal stability (e.g., a higher melting temperature, Tm), reduced aggregation propensity, and improved solubility. Such properties can be assessed using in vitro assays or in silico prediction tools.\n\nThe term \"fixed-dose regimen\" refers to a method of administration where a specific, constant dose of a therapeutic agent is administered to a patient at each dosing interval, regardless of the patient's body weight or other physiological parameters. This is in contrast to weight-based dosing or step-up dosing regimens.\n\nThe term \"cytokine release syndrome\" or \"CRS\" refers to a systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a large amount of cytokines from immune cells, which can occur as a side effect of immunotherapy. A \"reduction in CRS\" or \"reduced cytokine release\" refers to a statistically significant decrease in the incidence or severity of CRS in a patient population, or a decrease in the level of one or more pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1) in an in vitro or in vivo assay, compared to a control or parent antibody.\n\nAn \"isolated\" antibody is one which has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment."

The variants of the invention are designed to overcome limitations of the parent antibody, such as the potential to induce CRS and the requirement for a step-up dosing schedule. The variants are generated by introducing one or more amino acid modifications into the heavy chain variable (VH) and/or light chain variable (VL) domains of the antigen-binding arms, or into the Fc region of the antibody.\n\nThe bispecific antibodies of the invention comprise a first antigen-binding domain that specifically binds to human FcRH5 and a second antigen-binding domain that specifically binds to human CD3. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody is in an IgG-like format, for example, an IgG1 format with a knob-in-hole modification in the CH3 domains to promote correct heavy chain heterodimerization. The antibody may further comprise modifications in the Fc region to abrogate effector functions, such as binding to Fc\u03b3 receptors, to prevent non-specific T-cell activation. \n\nModifications to the amino acid sequence are guided by a combination of computational modeling and empirical testing. For instance, a murine precursor sequence containing motifs such as 'GSLKLS' may be humanized to a sequence containing 'GSLRLS' to reduce potential immunogenicity. Specific amino acid substitutions are introduced into the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) or framework regions (FRs) of the VH and VL domains to modulate antigen binding affinity, improve biophysical properties, or reduce immunogenicity. For example, substitutions may be made to remove potential aggregation hotspots or deamidation sites.\n\nIn some embodiments, the bispecific antibody comprises an anti-FcRH5 arm comprising a heavy chain variable region (VH) having a sequence with at least 90%, 95%, 98%, or 99% identity to a sequence designated as SEQ ID NO: 1 and a light chain variable region (VL) having a sequence with at least 90%, 95%, 98%, or 99% identity to a sequence designated as SEQ ID NO: 2. In some embodiments, the bispecific antibody comprises an anti-CD3 arm comprising a heavy chain variable region (VH) having a sequence with at least 90%, 95%, 98%, or 99% identity to a sequence designated as SEQ ID NO: 3 and a light chain variable region (VL) having a sequence with at least 90%, 95%, 98%, or 99% identity to a sequence designated as SEQ ID NO: 4.

      "text": "A key aspect of the invention is the use of advanced computational and in silico tools to guide the design and selection of antibody variants with improved properties. This data-driven approach allows for the high-throughput screening of a vast sequence space to identify candidates with a higher probability of success in subsequent experimental validation. The computational workflow provides robust support for the written description and enablement of the claimed variants.\n\nThe process begins with a high-resolution structural model of the parent bispecific antibody, which may be obtained through experimental methods like X-ray crystallography or generated using state-of-the-art protein structure prediction algorithms, such as Boltz-2, an advanced version of AlphaFold3. This reference structure serves as the template for variant design.\n\nVariant sequences are designed using protein design software such as ProteinMPNN or RFdiffusion. These tools can suggest amino acid substitutions that are predicted to maintain or improve the structural integrity and stability of the antibody. The design process can be constrained to specific regions, such as surface-exposed residues in the framework regions, to minimize disruption of the antigen-binding sites within the CDRs. The goal is to identify substitutions that enhance developability without compromising biological function.\n\nOnce a library of virtual variants is generated, each variant is subjected to a comprehensive in silico validation pipeline. This pipeline includes multiple predictive algorithms to assess key developability parameters:\n1.  **Structural Integrity:** The structure of each variant is predicted using tools like Boltz-2/AlphaFold3 to ensure that the introduced mutations do not lead to significant misfolding or distortion of the antibody structure.\n2.  **Aggregation Propensity:** Aggregation is a major concern for antibody therapeutics. The Aggrescan3D algorithm is used to identify and score aggregation-prone regions (APRs) on the protein surface. Variants are selected based on having a lower or more favorable Aggrescan3D score compared to the parent antibody.\n3.  **Solubility:** The NetSolP tool is used to predict the aqueous solubility of each variant. Candidates with higher predicted solubility are prioritized.\n4.  **Stability:** Thermal stability is predicted using tools like ThermoMPNN and EvoEF2, which calculate the change in Gibbs free energy of folding (\u0394\u0394G) upon mutation. Variants with a predicted negative \u0394\u0394G (indicating stabilization) are considered favorable.\n5.  **Immunogenicity:** The potential for an antibody to elicit an immune response is a critical safety concern. The DeepImmuno tool is used to predict T-cell epitope content by forecasting peptide binding to a panel of MHC class II alleles. Variants are designed to minimize the number and strength of predicted immunogenic epitopes.\n6.  **Docking and Binding:** Molecular docking simulations, using programs like DiffDock-L, can be employed to predict how the mutations might affect the binding interface and affinity for the target antigens, FcRH5 and CD3.\n\nThis rigorous in silico screening process, leveraging a suite of validated computational tools, enables the identification of a select pool of antibody variants with a high likelihood of possessing the desired profile of high efficacy and improved safety and developability. This computational enablement is a cornerstone of the invention, allowing for the rational design of superior therapeutic molecules."

      "text": "The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising the novel bispecific antibody variants described herein. Such compositions typically include the antibody and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. A \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like that are physiologically compatible.\n\nThe compositions may be formulated for parenteral administration, for example, by intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injection. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. For intravenous administration, the antibody is typically formulated in a solution buffered to a suitable pH and osmolality, such as a solution containing acetate, citrate, or histidine buffers, and excipients like sucrose or trehalose for stabilization.\n\nThe improved biophysical properties of the antibody variants, such as high solubility and low aggregation propensity, facilitate the development of high-concentration liquid formulations suitable for subcutaneous administration. Subcutaneous delivery is often preferred for chronic therapies as it allows for self-administration or administration in an outpatient setting, improving patient convenience and reducing healthcare costs.\n\nThe key advantage provided by the antibody variants of the invention is the ability to be administered via a fixed-dose regimen. Due to their reduced potential for inducing CRS, the initial dose can be the target therapeutic dose, eliminating the need for complex weight-based calculations or step-up dosing schedules. A typical fixed-dose regimen might involve administering a constant dose of the antibody (e.g., 50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg) on a periodic basis, such as once every week, once every two weeks, or once every three weeks."

The primary indication is a hematological malignancy, particularly a B-cell or plasma cell malignancy. In a preferred embodiment, the disease is multiple myeloma.\n\nThe methods of treatment are particularly applicable to patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). This includes patients who have failed prior lines of therapy, including proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, and anti-CD38 antibodies. Critically, the invention is also intended for the treatment of patients who are refractory to BCMA-targeting therapies, a population with limited treatment options and a significant unmet need.\n\nA method of treating a subject having multiple myeloma comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a bispecific antibody variant of the invention. A \"therapeutically effective amount\" is an amount sufficient to elicit a beneficial or desired clinical result, such as tumor regression, a reduction in tumor burden, or an improvement in progression-free survival or overall survival. The administration leads to the redirection of T-cells to kill FcRH5-expressing myeloma cells.\n\nA significant aspect of the therapeutic method is the improved safety profile. The method of treatment results in a reduced incidence or severity of CRS as compared to treatment with a parent FcRH5 x CD3 bispecific antibody. This improved safety enables the administration of the antibody via a fixed-dose regimen, which simplifies the treatment protocol and improves the overall patient experience. The subject can be administered a first dose of the antibody that is the same as a second and subsequent doses, without an intermediate, lower priming dose."

The objective was to identify amino acid modifications that reduce aggregation propensity and immunogenicity while maintaining structural integrity and stability. The entire process was performed using a validated in silico pipeline.\n\nA high-resolution three-dimensional structural model of the parent cevostamab antibody was generated using Boltz-2, a state-of-the-art deep learning-based protein structure prediction tool analogous to AlphaFold3. The resulting structure served as the scaffold for variant design. A library of 45 potential variant designs was then generated using ProteinMPNN. The design algorithm was focused on substituting surface-exposed, non-CDR residues in the framework regions of both the anti-FcRH5 and anti-CD3 arms of the antibody.\n\nEach of the 45 designed variants, along with the parent sequence, was subjected to a rigorous computational validation pipeline comprising 256 distinct validation analyses. Aggregation propensity was assessed using Aggrescan3D. The surface of each variant was analyzed to identify aggregation-prone regions (APRs), and a global aggregation score was calculated. Variants showing a decrease in the number or intensity of APRs compared to the parent molecule were prioritized. The analysis of 19 aggregation mapping files confirmed that specific substitutions in the framework regions could significantly reduce predicted aggregation hotspots.\n\nPredicted aqueous solubility was calculated for each variant using the NetSolP server. Candidates with a predicted increase in solubility were selected for further analysis. Thermal stability was evaluated by calculating the change in Gibbs free energy of folding (\u0394\u0394G) for each mutation using the EvoEF2 and ThermoMPNN algorithms.

Variants were screened for the removal of existing T-cell epitopes or the avoidance of introducing new ones. From this comprehensive in silico screening, a subset of top-performing variants was identified that demonstrated a consensus of improved properties across all metrics: reduced aggregation score, increased solubility, enhanced predicted stability, and a lower immunogenicity profile.

The amino acid sequences of the selected variants are codon-optimized for expression in a mammalian system, such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, and synthesized as DNA constructs. For a knob-in-hole bispecific antibody format, four separate expression vectors are prepared: one for the anti-FcRH5 heavy chain ('hole'), one for the anti-CD3 heavy chain ('knob'), one for the anti-FcRH5 light chain, and one for the anti-CD3 light chain (or a common light chain if applicable).\n\nCHO-S cells are transiently transfected with the expression vectors using a suitable transfection reagent, such as polyethylenimine (PEI). The cells are cultured in a chemically defined, serum-free medium at 37\u00b0C and 8% CO2. After 5-7 days of culture, the cell culture supernatant containing the secreted bispecific antibody is harvested by centrifugation to remove cells and cellular debris, followed by filtration through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter.\n\nThe secreted antibody is purified using a multi-step chromatography process. First, the clarified supernatant is loaded onto a Protein A affinity chromatography column. The column is washed with a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution to remove non-specifically bound proteins. The antibody is then eluted using a low-pH buffer, such as 0.1 M glycine, pH 3.0. The eluate is immediately neutralized by adding a Tris buffer to a final pH of 7.5.\n\nFractions containing the purified antibody are pooled and subjected to a second purification step to separate the desired heterodimeric bispecific antibody from homodimers (e.g., 'knob-knob' or 'hole-hole' homodimers) and other impurities. This is typically achieved using ion-exchange chromatography (IEX) or hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC), exploiting the differences in surface charge or hydrophobicity between the species. Finally, the purified bispecific antibody is buffer-exchanged into a formulation buffer (e.g., 20 mM histidine, 250 mM sucrose, pH 6.0) and concentrated using ultrafiltration. The purity of the final product is assessed by SDS-PAGE and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC-HPLC), and the concentration is determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm.

A variant is considered to have an improved safety profile if it induces a statistically significant reduction in the release of one or more key cytokines, particularly IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3, while maintaining potent cytotoxic activity as determined in Example 4. This result would provide strong evidence that the variant has a lower intrinsic potential to cause CRS and would support the clinical testing of a fixed-dose regimen."
